CSS
=======

Color Scheme
------------------

The default color scheme is set by /var/www/qwc2/html/assets/css/colorschemes.css

You can edit this file or copy it and create a new file.

If you create a new file, you must modify the config.json accordingly to your new css.

Application CSS
------------------

An override CSS file is contained at /var/www/qwc2/html/assets/css/qwc2.css

Entries will be loaded last and therefore over ride other CSS elements.

Note: Make sure that assets/css/qwc2.css is included in index.html.

Logo
----------------------

QWC2 logos are located at /var/www/qwc2/html/assets/img/

Thumbnails
----------------------

Map thumbnails in the end user panel are set via the Map page.

The default thumbnails are located at

/var/www/qwc2/html/assets/genmapthumbs 

If you add new thumbnails, you must update this in your themesConig.json
