Introduction
=====

The Quail QFieldCloud plugin synchronizes your QFieldCloud data to PostGIS.

You can sync to a remote or new local PostGIS database.

The synchronization service runs in the background at the interval you speficiy.  When you mobile is updated, your PostGIS database is updated.

You can also publish your data as WMS via Quail using either the PostGIS data or your QGIS Project.
